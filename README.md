# 🌺 .NET MAUI Training Repository

**Author:** Michael Bradford  
**Textbook:** *“.NET MAUI in Action”* by Matt Goldman (Manning Publications)  
**Framework:** .NET 9 SDK  
**Purpose:** To document my learning and development journey in building cross-platform applications using .NET MAUI, C#, and XAML.


## 📘 Overview

This repository contains projects, exercises, and labs completed while studying *“.NET MAUI in Action.”*  
It explores key concepts of modern multi-platform development, including:

- Cross-platform UI design with XAML  
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture  
- Data binding and commands  
- Dependency injection and navigation  
- Platform-specific APIs and services  
- Hot Reload and productivity tools  
- Integration with device hardware and sensors

Each lab builds practical understanding through hands-on projects designed for Android, Windows, and other supported platforms.
